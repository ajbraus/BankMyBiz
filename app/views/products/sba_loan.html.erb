      <h3>Micro Loans</h3>
      <p>
        The SBA offers a variety of programs, but primarily serves as a certified lender and advisor to small businesses.  One such program is the microloan program. <b>The microloan program provides loans up to $50,000 to U.S. based businesses</b>, with the average loan amount being around $13,000. This is an ideal program for many businesses who need less money than a typical business bank loan.  
      </p>

      <h3>Loan Guarantees</h3>
      <p>
        Another program is the <b>7(a) Loan Guarantee Program</b>. It is designed to assist entrepreneurs start or expand their businesses. As of 2010, the program makes up to $5 million available to small businesses through bank and non-bank institutions in the lending business. The <b>Small Business Jobs Act of 2010</b> permanently increased the maximum size of these loans from $2 million to $5 million.
      </p>

      <h3>Resource Centers Near You</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, the lending business is not the only one that the SBA engages in.  There are many resource centers including: <b>900 Small Business Development Centers</b>, <b>110 Women's Business Centers</b>, and <b>350 chapters of volunteers</b> who provide free mentoring under the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) program.  The SBA has many other niche programs, particularly for women and minority businesses.
