  "I own a healthcare business and my state contracts are growing everyday. I joined BankmyBiz.com, started some conversations on the news feed, and could immediately tell which lenders actually understood my business model by their comments.  I met with a few and, EUREKA, I found the right lender for my business.  We got the funding we were looking for and some additional tools. Thank You BankmyBiz.com! I will be singing your praises to every business owner I know."
