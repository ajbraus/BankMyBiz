        <h3>Accounts Receivable</h3>
        <p>
          A Factoring Loan is a business loan where a financial intermediary purchases receivables from a company. A factor is essentially a business loan that agrees to pay the company the value of the invoice minus a discount for commission and fees. The factor advances most of the invoiced amount to the company immediately and the balance upon  receipt of funds from the invoiced party. 
        </p>
        <h3>Find the Right Fit</h3>
        <p>
          Although factoring is a relatively expensive form of financing, factors provide a valuable service to (a) companies that operate in industries where it takes a long time to convert receivables to cash, and (b) companies that are growing rapidly and need cash to take advantage of new business growth opportunities.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Factoring is a great form of financing if it is a good fit for your company.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Customer's Creditworthiness</h3>
        <p>
          Note that the factor is more concerned with the creditworthiness of the invoiced party - Client Co. in the example above - rather than the company from which it has purchased the receivables (ABC Manufacturers Inc. in this case).  This is a good business loan for those who do not have the best credit.
        </p>

        <h3>A Good Example</h3>
        <p>
          For example, assume a factor has agreed to purchase an invoice of $1 million from ABC Manufacturers Inc., representing outstanding receivables from Client Co. The factor may discount the invoice by say 4%, and will advance $720,000 to ABC Manufacturers Inc. The balance of $240,000 will be forwarded by the factor to ABC Manufacturers Inc. upon receipt of the $1 million from Client Co. The factor's fees and commissions from this factoring deal amount to $40,000.
