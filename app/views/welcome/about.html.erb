        <h1 class='text-center'><i class="icon ion-beaker"></i> Relationship Recommendations</h1>
        <p>
          Bankmybiz is a <strong>Lending Relationship Network</strong>. Using key elements of your profile and the profiles of our network of lenders, we give you personalized Relationship Recommendations to introduce you to lenders that specialize in lending to businesses like yours.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lender is more than just a source of funding. Lenders are super connectors and mavens inside of business networks. When you work together they have all the incentive to make introductions for you to potential customers, suppliers, and ancillary services such as accountants and lawyers. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The internet is a fast and easy way to make connections, build trust, and start and continue relationships. On  Bankmybiz.com we provide a way to make connections fast and build trust and relationships from the comfort of your desktop or mobile phone.
