      <p>
        We believe in Relationship Lending. Having a relationship with a lender means a lot for the health and future success of your business. When you are looking for funding, you might really just be thinking about this next deal, but it is important to treat this deal as an opportunity to lay the relationships groundwork for the next and the next and the next.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lender is more than just a source of funding. Lenders are super connectors and mavens inside of business networks. When you work together they have all the incentive to make introductions for you to potential customers, suppliers, and ancillary services such as accountants and lawyers. 
      </p>
