        <h3>What is a Cash Advance?</h3>
        <p>
          A cash advance is a short-term loan where an individual borrows a small amount of money at a <strong>very high rate of interest</strong>. The individual borrower typically writes a post-dated personal check in the amount they wish to borrow plus a fee in exchange for cash. The lender holds onto the check and cashes it on the agreed upon date, usually the borrower's next payday. These loans are also called cash advance loans or check advance loans.

        <h3>Last Resort</h3>
        <p>
          If you have any business or personal credit avoid this form of funding! Even a credit card is better than a payday loan. For example, $17.50 per $100 for a seven day loan, although it sounds OK, that translates into a rate of more than 900% a year. Most loans are for 30 days or less and can be rolled over for additional finance charges. Loan amounts are usually from $100 to $1,500. Note that this is a personal loan not a business loan (such as Factoring or Term Loans). Be very cautious about funding a business through this type of loan.
